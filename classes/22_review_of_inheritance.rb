#inheritance is a way of obtaining all methods from another class
#allows us to avoid duplicate of the code
#the class we inherit from is called a super class
 #or a parent class
#the class that inherits is called the subclass or child class
#in ruby there is only single inheritance - a class can inherit only from one other class
#subclass is a type of the superclass. It is a "is-a" relationship
#example: a car is a vehicle but a vehicle is not car for 100% of  times
#subclasses are fallowed by a < symbol and the name of the superclass
