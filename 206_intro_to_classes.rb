#class is a blueprint for a object
#hashes, regex, arrays are classes,
#however ruby do not cover all classes like user, invoice etc.
#goal of object oriented programing is to model real life design
#object is a custom container of data. It is made from class
#object groups functionalieties in a single object

##Object atributes and methods
#object includes instance variables (attributes), variables belonging to object
  #attributes provide information about aboject current state
  #those are characteristic of a object
  #ie book is red, has this aouthor, is 4 yr old

#Instance methods- interactions
  #book can be opened, read, thrown
  #encapsulation - OOP concept- object triest to restric access to its data
    #prevent from manipulation whitout msg
    #only allow object to be interacted with by specyfic method
    #protecting data!

##Classes and object
  #Class - is like a factory- deignates general shape of the  Object
  #object is a instance of the class - it is created from the class

##Instantion - process of creating object from the class
#class sometimes is called a abstract type
  #it hides complexities of interacting with the data
  #method hids complexities of interacting with a process
